## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">Inspiration üí≠</span>

Especially after the COVID pandemic, we have come to realize the importance of staying connected. We all experienced distancing relationships to some extent, and sometimes...it doesn't feel great. We were inspired to build a tool to not only help us maintain, but _value and cherish relationships with those we care about_.

## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">What it does ü¶æ</span>

**SocialRM** is a personal relationship management tool that helps us keep in touch with those we might not talk to often. **SocialRM** centralizes all your contacts you wish to keep up with, but has another trick up its sleeve. The hardest part of occasionally keeping up with tens or hundreds of people is remembering every single person and finding the time to reach out and write a personal message. **SocialRM** gathers information you enter into a table in _seconds_, then generates and sends incredibly personalized, friendly emails at your desired frequency.

## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">How we built it ‚öíÔ∏è</span>

We built **SocialRM** as a web app using Next.js, Firestore and Firebase Auth. Our UI was carefully crafted in Figma and then brought to life using Tailwind CSS. Our generation AI is powered by Cohere's natural language processing APIs, enabling **SocialRM** to produce realistic yet customizable chat phrases. Finally, we send your amazing messages with Flask, Python, and google's Gmail API. Through streamlined OAuth2, the entire process is _unbelievably quick and easy_.

## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">Challenges and obstacles üöß</span>

As this was our first time working with Cohere, it took extensive research and trial and error before we finally figured out how to maximize the power of Cohere's generation technology. We were on the brink of changing gears halfway through, but fortunately a brief word with _Cohere themselves_ sparked our imaginations and success with the final project.

A second challenge we encountered was figuring out exactly how to use Google's Gmail API effectively and efficiently, leading us to eventually develop a separate backend script in Python for this purpose.

## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">Our accomplishments üèÜ</span>

**SocialRM** has been an _incredible learning process_ for each of us, and we have a lot to owe to the well organized workshops and sponsors for providing us with such an unbelievable learning experience. We each dove into technologies we were originally unfamiliar with, ultimately succeeding and producing a project we are all very proud of. We are also very grateful for the opportunity to meet and connect with so many other skilled hackers and mentors here at Hack the North.

## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">What we learned üìö</span>

Of course, we learned much about and how to work with many new and fascinating technologies, but ultimately we learned that problem solving and overcoming obstacles is an experience better shared with a team. Collaboration and teamwork have been rare opportunities for the past few pandemic years, and _we are so excited to be back._

## <span style="color:#8b5cf6">What's next for \***\*SocialRM\*\*** ü§ñ</span>

We would like to expand the features of **SocialRM** to be include more support for relationship features. For example, a wider customizability for circle can make it easier to group and manage messages to certain people. We may also implement support for text messaging aside form the current email messaging, using technologies such as Twilio.

**We want to make SocialRM as supportive and helpful as possible for everyone's benefit and mental health!**
