# Social RM

## Inspiration

Especially after the global COVID pandemic, we have come to realize the importance of staying connected. We all experienced distance in relationships to some extent, and sometimes it...doesn't feel great. We were inspired to build a tool to not only help us maintain, but value and cherish relationships with those we care about.

## What it does

SocialRM is a personal relationship management tool that helps us keep in touch with those we might not talk to often. SocialRM automatically creates and sends (with your approval, of course) realistic emails to send to your contacts every once in a while, keeping you in touch.

## How we built it

We build SocialRM as a web app using Next.js with Firebase storage for our users. Our UI was carefully crafted in Figma and then brought to life using Tailwind CSS's powerful classes. Our generation technology is powered by Cohere's natural language processing APIs, enabling SocialRM to produce realistic yet customizable chat phrases.

## Challenges we ran into

As this was our first time working with Cohere, it took some research and trial and error before we finally figured out how to maximize the power of Cohere's generation technology. We were on the brink of changing gears halfway through, but fortunately a brief word with Cohere themselves sparked our recovery and success with the final project.

A second challenge we encountered was figuring out exactly how to use Google's Gmail API effectively and efficiently, leading us to eventually develop a separate backend script in Python for this purpose.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

SocialRM has been an immense learning process for each of us, and we have a lot to owe to the well organized workshops and sponsor speakers for providing us with such an incredible learning experience. We each dove into technologies we were originally unfamiliar with, ultimately succeeding and producing a project we are all very proud of. We are also very grateful for the opportunity to meet and connect with so many other skilled hackers and mentors here at Hack the North.

## What we learned

Of course, we learned how to work with many new and fascinating technologies, but ultimately we learned that problem solving and overcoming obstacles as an experience better shared with a team.
